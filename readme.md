# mspc::channel

Threads allow you to achieve concurrency by executing multiple tasks concurrently, but they also introduce challenges related to synchronization, communication, and data safety. This is where constructs like `mpsc` channels become valuable.


* Rust standard library provides 1-1 threading model
* 1 Language (user) Thread per OS thread
* concurrent program execution is *non-deterministic*
* mpsc ~ multiple producers, 1 consumer

> "Green" threads, also known as "lightweight" threads or "greenlets," are a form of concurrency where the runtime or a library manages threads at a higher level than the operating system.

## Channel manages threads

The channel in Rust's `std::sync::mpsc` module helps manage the communication and synchronization between threads. It acts as a structured conduit for messages, ensuring safe and ordered communication between threads.


### Why do we use "move" ?

The purpose of using `move` in this code is to ensure that the producer thread's closure can continue to send messages through the channel even after the `main` function continues executing. By taking ownership of the `tx` variable, the closure can continue to use it without being hindered by lifetime constraints that borrowing might introduce.

`let producer_thread = thread::spawn(move || { // ... });`

## Any disadvantages with using channels?

While channels in Rust, like those provided by `std::sync::mpsc`, offer many advantages for concurrent programming, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider:

1. **Complexity:** Using channels introduces additional complexity to your code, especially when dealing with multiple threads and synchronization. You need to ensure that you're sending and receiving messages correctly and that you're handling errors and thread safety properly.
2. **Performance Overhead:** Using channels introduces a certain amount of performance overhead compared to direct in-memory communication between threads. This overhead comes from the synchronization mechanisms and data copying involved in sending and receiving messages.
3. **Deadlocks:** Incorrect usage of channels can lead to deadlocks, where threads are waiting for each other indefinitely. Deadlocks can be challenging to diagnose and fix.
4. **Resource Usage:** Channels can consume system resources, particularly memory, when dealing with large amounts of data or a high number of messages. It's important to monitor and manage resource usage.
5. **Ordering and Priority:** Channels provide ordered message delivery, but this might not always be desirable in certain scenarios. If you need a different ordering or prioritization of messages, you'll need to implement it explicitly.
6. **Limited to Same Process:** Channels are typically designed for communication between threads within the same process. If you need to communicate between different processes or machines, other communication mechanisms like networking might be more suitable.
7. **Concurrency Bugs:** While channels help manage synchronization, they don't eliminate the possibility of concurrency bugs entirely. You still need to ensure proper synchronization and handle edge cases to prevent issues like race conditions.
8. **Learning Curve:** If you're new to concurrent programming or Rust's ownership and borrowing concepts, understanding how to correctly use channels and manage threads can be a bit challenging.

It's important to note that while there are potential disadvantages, channels in Rust are well-designed and can help mitigate many of these issues by providing a safe and structured way to handle concurrent communication. The key to using channels effectively is understanding their strengths and limitations, and writing code that properly manages synchronization and ownership.
